Coming out of my cage and I've been doing just fine
Gotta, gotta be down because I want it all
It started out with a kiss; how did it end up like this?
It was only a kiss; it was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep and she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke and she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed, and my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head, but she's touching his
